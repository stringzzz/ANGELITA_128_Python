# ANGELITA_128_Python
My ANGELITA 128-bit Encryption system, now in Python

Completely compatible with the previous C++ implementation. 
Not unexpectedly, the Python implementation is far slower than the other.
The entire goal was just to rewrite it into Python so it would work exactly the same,
even though the code is arguably very different. It was a good excercise, and I hope someone
will get something out of it.
